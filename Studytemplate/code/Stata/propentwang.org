* Propensity model

In the case of more than two treatment alternatives, we use the Stata
interface to the R-package TWANG
develloped by Ridgeway, McCaffrey, Griffin and Burgette (2014), see
correct reference on www.rand.org/statistics/twang. The method is based on regression trees to weight the
observations to obtain comparable populations. The procedure enable
estimation of treatment effects in terms om /ATE/ - average treatment
effect on the population (on average treatment effect if all were
given the two treatment alternatives) and /ATT/ - average treatment
effect on the treated (the average change in effect if those treated
were given the alternative treatment instead).

The propensity model use the following covariates for
treatment prediction:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 =[dis "$PVAR1"]=
 =[dis "$PVAR2"]=.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC Stata
  /* This code is good for two treatment alternatives */
